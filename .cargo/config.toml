# This config uses (unstable) features to improve compile times.
#
# "-fuse-ld=mold"
# One of the slowest aspects of compiling large Rust programs is the linking time. This file configures Mold as
# an alternate linker that significantly improves linking time.
# https://github.com/rui314/mold
#
# "-Zshare-generics=y"
# Unstable. Make the current crate share its generic instantiations
# Note that you may have some issues with this flag on Windows. If compiling fails due to the 65k symbol limit,
# you may have to disable this setting. For more information and possible solutions to this error, see
# <https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1110>.
#
# "-Zthreads=0"
# Unstable. Enables rustc's parallel frontend, which improves performance when parsing, type checking, borrow
# checking, and more. We currently set `threads=0`, which defaults to the amount of cores in your CPU.
###########################
# Features improving runtime performance.
#
# "-Clinker-plugin-lto"
# "-flto"
# Allows for deferring the LTO optimization to the actual linking step, which in turn allows for performing
# interprocedural optimizations across programming language boundaries if all the object files being linked
# were created by LLVM based toolchains. The prime example here would be linking Rust code together with
# Clang-compiled C/C++ code. Note that the Rust code has to be compiled with -C linker-plugin-lto and the
# C/C++ code with -flto or -flto=thin so that object files are emitted as LLVM bitcode.
#
# "+atomics"
# Enables thread synchronization primitives in the WebAssembly instruction set.
# This is one of the required steps to allow multi-threading in WebAssembly.
#
# "+simd128"
# Enables simd128 in the WebAssembly instruction set.
# Increases performance for work benefitting from SIMD.
###########################
# Other features used.
#
# "+crt-static"
# Enables a statically linked runtime. Useful for running in e.g. "stratch" Docker containers.
