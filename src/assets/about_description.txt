VOWL-R is an open-source ontology visualization tool developed to provide an enhanced user experience and improved performance over the original WebVOWL. It is built on the Visual Notation for OWL ontologies (VOWL) and keeps the familiar concepts that users know, while updating the technology behind it.
Leveraging modern web techologies, VOWL-R offers a more intuitive and responsive interface for navigating large ontologies. It introduces major improvements in loading speed, memory efficiency, and graph rendering performance, enabling seamless exploration even of large-scale ontologies.
